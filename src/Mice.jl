    Imputes missing values in a dataset using the MICE algorithm. 
    The output is a `Mids` object.

    The data containing missing values (`data`) must be supplied as a `Tables.jl` table.

    The number of imputations created is specified by `m`.

    The variables will be imputed in the order specified by `visitSequence`. 
    The default is sorted by proportion of missing data in ascending order; 
    the order can be customised using a vector of variable names in the desired order.

    The imputation method for each variable is specified by the `NamedArray` `methods`. 
    The default is to use predictive mean matching (`pmm`) for all variables. 
    Currently only `pmm` is supported. 
    Any variable not to be imputed can be marked as such using an empty string ("").

    The predictor matrix is specified by the `NamedArray` `predictorMatrix`. 
    The default is to use all other variables as predictors for each variable. 
    Any variable not predicting another variable can be marked as such in the matrix
    using a 0.

    The number of iterations is specified by `iter`.

    If `progressReports` is `true`, a progress indicator will be displayed in the console.

    `gcSchedule` dictates when the garbage collector will be (additionally) invoked. The 
    number provided is the fraction of your RAM remaining at which the GC will be called.
    For small datasets, you may get away with a value of `0.0` (never called), but for larger
    datasets, it may be worthwhile to call it more frequently. The default is to call it 
    after each iteration of each variable (`1.0`), but this may negatively affect
    performance if it is not necessary for your dataset.

    `threads` dictates whether multi-threading will be used. This will improve performance
    for larger jobs if and only if Julia has been launched with multiple threads (which you
    can verify by calling `Threads.nthreads()`). The default is `false`.
